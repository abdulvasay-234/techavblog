    <h2 class="title">What are data structures & algorithms?</h2>
    
    <p>The term data structure is used to describe how the data is stored and the algorithm is 
        used to describe how data is pressed, both data and algorithm are irrelated to each other, 
        Where Data structure is nothing but a representation of the logical relationship between each
        element of the data. In other words, a data structure helps you organize all the data items
        that consider the way data elements are stored and their relationship to one another. </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm is a finite set of instructions, 
            which is used toaccomplish a particular task.
            Each of which has a clear meaning and can be 
            performed with a finite number of efforts by a
            finite length of time. The best thing about the algorithm is that it doesn’t 
            matter what input values may be,
            the algorithm terminates after executing a finite number of instructions.
        </p>
        <p><b>The data structure is represented as: </b></p>
        <p id="algo">Algorithm + Data structure= program</p>

        <h2 class="title">What are ALGORITHM</h2>
        <p>
            An algorithm is a step-by-step process, 
            which is to be followed when writing an algorithm
            to define a set of instructions in a certain order
            to get the output, algorithm can be written in more
            than one programming language. According to the data structure, 
            some of the important categories of the algorithm are,
        </p>
        <ul class="title">
            <li>Insert- an element is inserted in the data structure</li>
            <li>Sort- element is sorted (arranged) in a certain order in the data structure</li>
            <li>Search- an element is searched in the data structure</li>
            <li>Delete- an element is deleted in the data structure</li>
            <li>Update- element is updated in the data structure</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title">HOW TO WRITE AN ALGORITHM</h2>
        <p>
             Well, there is no well-defined structure for 
            writing an algorithm. Algorithms are never written
            to be code for any particular programming language.
            We may know that all programming language(s) share
            some of the basic code constructures, 
            like flow-control (if, else); loops (for, do, while), 
            etc. these common 
            constructure can help you in writing an algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that we write an algorithm in step-by-step 
            order but, it is not in all cases. Writing an 
            algorithm is the process of execution after the 
            problem domain is well defined. Before you begin 
            writing an algorithm you must know the main problem domain, 
            for which you are about to design the solution.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the examples are given to understand more about how to write an algorithm:</p>
        <h3 class="title">EXAMPLE 1</h3>
        <p><b>Write an algorithm to add 2 numbers,</b></p>
        <p>
           <b>STEP 1 -</b> start       <br>
	       <b>STEP 2 -</b> read a, b   <br>
           <b>STEP 3 -</b> sum a+b     <br>
           <b>STEP 4 -</b> print      <br>
           <b>STEP 5 -</b> stop       <br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">EXAMPLE 2</h3>
        <p><b>Check the eligibility of getting driving licence</b></p>
        <p>
           <b>STEP 1 -</b> start       <br>
	       <b>STEP 2 -</b> read age   <br>
           <b>STEP 3 -</b> if age >= 18 then go to step_4 else step_5     <br>
           <b>STEP 4 -</b> writ “The person is eligible to get driving licences”      <br>
           <b>STEP 5 -</b> writ “The person is not eligible to get driving licences”       <br>
           <b>STEP 6 -</b> Stop
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not necessarily that one must write an algorithm 
            in the same way as mentioned above, the algorithm tells 
            the programmer how to code to the given problem domain 
            effectively. Moreover, we design algorithms to get the 
            solution to a given problem. 
            The problem can be solved in more than one way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="title">PERFORMANCE OF ALGORITHM</h2>
        <p>The efficiency of the algorithm is mostly dependent on</p>
        
        <ul class="title">
            <li>Time complexity</li>
            <li>Space complexity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="title">TIME COMPLEXITY:</h3>  
        <p>
            The amount of time required for the algorithm to 
            complete its execution is the time complexity. 
            An algorithm is said to be efficient if it takes a 
            minimum(reasonable) 
            amount of time to complete the execution.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">SPACE COMPLEXITY:</h3>
        <p>
            It’s the space occupied by the algorithm is known as 
            space complexity. An algorithm is said to be efficient 
            if it takes less space and 
            required less amount of time to complete its execution.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS</h2>
        <p>
            Asymptotic analysis is the algorithm that 
            refers to defining the mathematical bounding/framing 
            of its run time. Asymptotic helps you to find the best, average, worst, case scenario of an algorithm. Asymptotic analysis refers to the computing time of any operation 
            in a mathematical unit of computation.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the running time of one operation is 
            computed as f(n) and another operation took to compute 
            g(n^2). This means that the first operation running 
            time will increase linearly with the increase in n and 
            the running time of the second operation will increase 
            exponentially when n is increased.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time required to compute by the algorithm fall under three (3) categories:
        </p>
        <ul class="title">
            <li> <b> O NOTATION (Best case) –</b> minimum time required for the execution of the program</li>
            <li> <b>Ω NOTATION (Average case) - </b> average time required for the execution of the program</li>
            <li> <b>Θ NOTATION (Worst case) – </b> maximum time required for the execution of the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title">Why do we need to study DSA?</h2>
        <p>
            In this, we will learn why one should learn Data 
            structure and algorithm (DSA), by learning Data 
            structure and algorithm (DSA) you can understand 
            the concept of the data and how to store the data in 
            a way that can be found easily so that the user doesn’t
            face any problem finding out the data. As the 
            applications are getting big and complex and increase 
            in data, there are three (3) 
            commonly problems that may occur in the application
        </p>
        <ol class="title">
            <li>Data search</li>
            <li>Processor speed</li>
            <li>Multiple requests</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            To overcome this problem, we use data structures in 
            this Data structure and algorithm (DSA) we will see 
            the time and space complexity of the code and the best 
            possible way to store the data. 
            There are a few ways by which you can store the data,
        </p>
        <ul class="title">
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>Stacks and queues</li>
            <li>Linked list</li>
            <li>Trees</li>
            <li>Graphs</li>
            <li>Selection and sorting.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="pdf/graph.png" alt="" class="title">

        <h2 class="title">ARRAY:</h2>
        <p>
            An array is a type of data structure that stores 
            homogeneous elements in a memory location which are 
            contiguous. The main concept of an array is to store 
            multiple data in one location where each data is stored together 
            to save memory and time to search the data. The data 
            (or) objects which are of the same type are stored in 
            the same order in the array. The size of the array 
            needs to be defined before the data is stored in the 
            array. Any data stored in the array can be accessed 
            and modified easily. The data which are stored in the 
            array are given a subject (or) 
            index to identify the location of the data stored.
        </p>
            <h3 class="title">EXAMPLE:</h3>
            <img src="pdf/array.png" alt="" class="title">

   <br>  <br> 
            <p>
                let’s, store the marks of 20 students, then the size 
                of an array has to be mentioned as 20. Then the 
                student's marks can then be stored in the created 
                array without creating separate variables for marks 
                for every student. A Simple traversal 
                of an array could be done to access the elements.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">STACK</h2>
            <p>
                A stack is a linear data structure, where elements 
                are inserted and deleted only from one end, that is 
                the top of the stack. Stack follows the principle of 
                LIFO (last in first out). The elements which are last 
                in the stack will be deleted first as the elements can 
                only be added from the top. So, the element which is added 
                last will be the one that needs to be removed first.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best example to understand the stack properties 
                would be arranging the books according to their Roll 
                number where the first roll number’s book goes at the 
                bottom and the book of the last roll number is placed 
                at the top. And if the books need to be distributed to 
                students again the first book goes to the last roll 
                number person. the items can only be added or removed 
                only from the top that is the last item to 
                be added to a stack will be removed first from the stack.
